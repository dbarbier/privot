\section{Use Cases Guide}

This section presents the main functionalities of the module $MultivariateRandomMixture$ in their context.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Which python modules to import ?}

In order to use the functionalities described in this documentation, it is necessary to import the module 
using the following Python script~:

\begin{lstlisting}
# Load OpenTURNS to manipulate distributions
import MultivariateRandomMixture as MV
# other possibility
from MultivariateRandomMixture import *
# or
from MultivariateRandomMixture import PythonMultivariateRandomMixture
\end{lstlisting}
$openturns$ is imported into~: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item $MV.ot$ within the first use,
   \item $ot$ within the second use.
\end{itemize}

We could also import $openturns$ separately to the module.


\subsection{Creation of a multivariate random mixture through the PythonMultivariateRandomMixture class} \label{MVRM}

In $MultivariateRandomMixture$, it is possible to create a python class for the manipulation of the multivariate random mixture distribution.
The multivariate random mixture is considered as an affine transformation of random vector of independant marginals. 
The parameters are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the collection of distributions ($DistributionCollection$) which characterize the input random vector,
 \item the $Matrix$ of the affine transformation, 
 \item the constant vector ($NumericalPoint$) of the affine transformation.
\end{itemize}

The return objet is a distribution which inherites from the $PythonDistribution$ class.
