 * concurently (multithreading). The state is destroyed when the Numerical MathFunctionObject is
 * destroyed.
 * The state is not used by the NumericalMathFunction object. This one only takes a pointer to the
 * memory space allocated by the wrapper, and ensures that it is given as the first argument
 * of each wrapper function, so that each function can save and reload ths state.
 * Because the NumericalMathFunction object only sees the state as an obscure pointer (void *),
