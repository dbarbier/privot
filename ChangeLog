    Added the DickeyFullerTest class.
    This class enables to perform the Dickey Fuller test to check the stationarity of a time series.
    Three models are usually investigated and a strategy may be launched thanks to runStrategy.
    The class is not static comparing to other stat class tests due to the reuse of information while executing the strategy.  The constructor takes a time series as argument.  Intermediate tests of the strategy are visible.
    The complete table of Dickey Fuller is not available. But asymptotic DickeyFuller quantile and cumulative functions were added. These are based on three values (0.01, 0.05 and 0.10) and a linear approximation. The final functions will be more efficient
    Added test files for DickeyFullerTest class
    Disabled DickeyFuller tests (library and python)
    Added CovarianceModelFactoryImplementation and CovarianceModelFactory class
    Added UserDefinedCovarianceModel class
    Added NonStationaryCovarianceModelFactory class.
    The class enables to estimate a covariance model using a sample of data and no particular hypothesis.
    Rewrite NonStationaryCovarianceModelFactory::build to use less memory.
    The initial version used an N*dimension auxiliary NumericalSample to compute its CovarianceMatrix.  It is more memory efficient to compute (N*dimension)*(N*dimension+1)/2 matrices.
    Added missing tests for UserDefinedCovarianceModel class
    Added missing tests for NonStationaryCovarianceModel class.
    Added the class UserDefinedStationaryCovarianceModel
    Added library tests for UserDefinedStationaryCovarianceModel
    Added the StationaryCovarianceModelFactory class.
    This class enables to estimate a stationary covariance model using the spectral density information. An FFT inversion is used to estimate the covariance model.
    The discretization is similar to the Fogli's one.
    Added StationaryCovarianceModelFactory tests.
    Added the ARMALikelihoodFactory library class.
    The class enables to estimate multivariate ARMA models using the likelihood function.
    As the usual algorithm is based on the inversion of the covariance matrix, we use a more efficient algorithm (cf J.A. Mauricio).
    For the optimization algorithm, default initial values are estimated using the WhittleFactory if user does not set ones.
    The class returns an exception if both p and q are 0.
    Added ARMALikelihoodFactory keys in ResourceMap.
    The algorithm here consists in separating elementary tasks:
    - Compute the theoritical cross/auto covariance matrices. These are stored in  crossCovariance_ and autoCovariance_ attributes.
    - Assemble the information and covariance matrices (Omega, Sigma, V...)
    - Compute the cholesky factor and solve a linear system
    - Compute the objective value
    The coefficientsBlockMatrix_ attribute stores the coefficients of the model. Care to the difference of conventions between Mauricio and OpenTurns ones.
    Transpose and rename coefficientsBlockMatrix_ matrix.
    Most matrix multiplications with phi and theta are matrices are:
      phi * B or B * phi^{T}
    Since OpenTurns use a column storage, it is more efficient to compute
      M_{ij} = A_{ik} B_{kj}
            = (A^{T})_{ki} B_{kj}
    This is why transposed matrices are stored, and coefficientsBlockMatrix_ is renamed into blockPhiTThetaTMatrix_.
    For the same reason, switch some loops on rows and columns.
    Fix several occurrences of (currentP_ - 1) which may cause trouble when currentP_ is 0.
    Added a particular case of compute covariance method for pure AR models. This method enables to compute the covariance matrix using the white noise covariance matrix of size p.
    Removed some useless boolean variables and added verbose accessors.
    Renamed the logLikelihhod function and completed the method. This enables to compute the main factor of the likelihood function.
    Completed the ComputeObjectiveAndConstraint method by setting the constraints on AR values, MA values and covariance matrix.
    Completed the build method by launching the cobyla algorithm.
    Made some cleaning and fixed some minor bugs.
    Added ARMALikelihood library tests
    Added missing ARMALikelihood python test
    Updated ARMALikelihood library test
    Fixed minor bugs in ARMALikelihoodFactory with pure AR estimate
    Fixed type error in ResourceMap
    Transpose productPhiLambda in order to improve memory access
    Implement all steps as in Mauricio's paper.
    In computeV1_Omega_V1T_Cholesky, V1*Omega*V1T may have null eigenvalues.
    As the computeCholesky() method only works on positive definite matrices,
    we must use a modified Cholesky decomposition which also works with
    semidefinite positive matrices.
    Likelihood gives the same result as in Mauricio's code.
    DickeyFullerTest does not compile with g++ 4.7
    In DickeyFuller, rewrote the pValue of intermediate Student tests
    Fixed a bug with the write of critical region for unit root test : the null hypothesis is a non stationarity
    Added missing ARMALikelihoodFactory keys in openturs.conf file
    Update values in ResourceMap
    Fix computation of likelihood.  Results have been validated against
    Fortran code with (p,q) = (2,0), (2,1), (0,2) and (1,2).

	  Enhanced TUI integration of UserDefined class.
	  Added a simplified constructor for the IndependentCopula
	  dependence structure.
	  Enhanced user interface of UserDefined class
	  (PersistentCollection for the attributes, Collection for the user
	  interface).
	  Enhanced computeCharacteristicFunction() method.
	  Added a new distribution RandomMixture that allow to manipulate
	  as a distribution any linear combination of independent 1D
	  distributions. Not so well tested, and not documented. See it as
	  an experimental feature.
	  Added a simple but quite efficient mechanism to reduce the
	  boundary effect, for the 1D case.
	  Enhanced the memory consumption (getNumericalSample() method),
	  improved the performance (drawPDF() and drawCDF() methods) for
	  DistributionImplementation class.
	  Fixed a bug in the computeQuantile() method of multidimensional
	  distributions. Now, we use anly the very robust (but quite slow)
	  bisection method instead of the (faster but less robust) secant
	  method.
	  Enhanced Last and Compact strategy classes to reduce memory
	  impact.
	  Desactivated the cache mechanism of NumericalMathFunction within
	  the Simulation algorithms to avoid usesless memory consumption.
	  Improved cache management in Simulation class.
	  Fixed minor typo in UserManual.
	  Speed compilation of the SWIG wrapper.
	  Changed some compilation options in order to preserve user's
	  choice when compiling. CFLAGS, FFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and CPPFLAGS are
	  no more altered by configuration script. They are set by m4
	  standard macros as usual. So the user can now change their values
	  from the outside of the building process (configure CXXFLAGS=...
	  or make CXXFLAGS=... work in conjonction with the values found by
	  configure). Any optimisation can be avoided by setting these
	  variables to empty string.
	  An wrong version of SWIG does not make compilation fails anymore.

	  Manage exchanged data at wrapper internal state creation time.
	  Input and output point sizes are now computed from exchanged data
	  (not hard coded in wrapper any more).
	  Removed unused NumericalWrapperFunction.
	  Make wrapper load more robust. An alternate function is provided
	  if none is present in the wrapper. This makes almost any function
	  in the wrapper optional.
	  More debug messages when loading wrapper to help understanding
	  the internal behavior of the platform.
	  New minimal wrapper to show the minimal set of definition for a
	  wrapper (to help users define new wrappers).
	  Fix bug in WrapperFile.cxx (some optional tags were not so
	  optional).
	  Add regular expression detection for use in wrappers.
	  Add temporary directory creation and destruction for use in
	  wrappers.
	  Add current working directory function for use in wrappers.
	  Compile Python scripts at installation for speeding tests.
	  Add functions to read files in wrappers.
	  Fix bug in test/Makefile.am that prevent some tests from running
	  because of a not found configuration file.
	  Better SWIG detection in macro ot_check_swig.m4.
	  Add copy of wrapper input files to temporary directory.
	  Add substitutions of variables into input files before copying.
	  Fix bug due to AM_PYTHON_PATH macro that weaps out CPPFLAGS
	  precious variable.
	  Add parsing of output files for retrieving data.
	  Add poutre.sh external code which uses files for argument
	  passing.
	  Wrapped poutre.sh in poutre_external.xml file.
	  Substituted variables in files for input and output.
	  Add C++ and Python tests in Autotest suites.
	  Change wrapper interface so now state is always passed to
	  wrapper.
	  Change debug symbol definitions.
	  Change wrapper DTD to help wrappers to be more generic. Change
	  XML files and parser in concordance.
	  Remove useless debug output in test files.
	  Add a new set of wrapper helper functions stored in libOTwrapper
	  library.
	  Detect and fix a new bug : wrapper initialization and
	  finalization functions were not called. Bug not registered.

	  trunk> svn merge -r 146:169 http://.../branches/arch
	  
	  Stat objects (LinearModel, Test and associated) and corresponding
	  test files.
	  Modified some target directory for examples and include files.
	  Modified all files that include OT*.hxx headers in order to swith
	  from
	  #include <openturns/...> notation to #include "..." notation.
	  Modified all Makefile.am files in concordance.
	  Deletion of include/Makefile.am in order to move header files one
	  level up.
	  Moved include files one level up (removed openturns directory).
	  Many minor bug fixes (removed all warnings).
	  Improved FORTRAN / C / C++ interoperability.
	  Fix dependency bugs in test/Makefile.am.
	  Automatic generation of package.m4 file (needed by autotest).
	  Improved detection of Xerces-C library.
	  Moved configure.in to configure.ac.
	  New naming for tests (number replaced by name).
	  Moved tests from 'make check' to 'make installcheck' because of
	  implementation of distribution over R.
	  Add rotRPackage package to the distribution.
