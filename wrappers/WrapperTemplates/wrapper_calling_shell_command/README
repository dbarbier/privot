This is an example for creating, building and installing a new wrapper for OpenTURNS.
Please follow the instructions below before calling for help.

Getting started:
* First, run
  ./configure --prefix=the_path_where_your_wrapper_will_be_installed --with-openturns=the_path_where_openturns_is_installed

* Then, build your wrapper (here, named 'wcode'. You can change the name in configure.ac and Makefile.am)
  make

* At last, install your wrapper in 'the_path_where_your_wrapper_will_be_installed'
  make install
 
To get your wrapper seen by OpenTURNS, you should set the environment variable OPENTURNS_WRAPPER_PATH
in sh-like shells (sh, bash, ksh, etc.):
OPENTURNS_WRAPPER_PATH=the_path_where_your_wrapper_will_be_installed/wrappers
export OPENTURNS_WRAPPER_PATH

in csh-like shells (csh, tcsh, etc.):
setenv OPENTURNS_WRAPPER_PATH the_path_where_your_wrapper_will_be_installed/wrappers

That's all !
