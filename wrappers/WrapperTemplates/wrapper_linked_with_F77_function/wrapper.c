/* WARNING : Please read the following lines
 *
 * In this program, we make the assumption that the end user wishes to
 * call a function (aka NumericalMathFunction) named "wcode" (wcode stands
 * for wrapped code).
 * In order to individualize the wrapper to the user's needs, we encourage
 * you (as the developer of this wrapper) to rename any occurence of "wcode"
 * (in either case) to the real name of the function.
 * It will also avoid any confusion with other "wcode"s written by other entities
 * or developers.
 */

/* If you plan to link this wrapper against a FORTRAN library,
 * remember to change the name WCODE for your actual FORTRAN subroutine name.
 * Otherwise you can ignore these lines.
 *
 * Remember that FORTRAN passes its arguments by reference, not by value as C and C++
 * usually do. So you need to pass the pointer to the arguments rather than its value.
 * This is true for single values (integers, reals, etc.) but not for arrays that are
 * already pointers in the C/C++ environment. Those ones can directly be passed as
 * "values" though they are pointers indeed.
 * Be careful that C and C++ arrays start from 0 and FORTRAN from 1!
 * Be also very careful with the size of the value your plan to pass. Integers in C/C++
 * are not INTEGER*8 in many cases. Float or doubles do not necessarily match REAL*4
 * or REAL*8 in FORTRAN.
 *
 * FORTRAN gives no clue for preventing const values from being altered. So you need to
 * protect them by copying them before calling the FORTRAN subroutine if this import
 * to you.
 *
 * Summary: there are only exceptions to the rule and you need to
 * know exactly what you are doing! You may be desappointed at first, but it will keep
 * you away from segmentation violation and other similar fantasies. ;-)
 */

/* If you want to customize this wrapper to your needs, you have to do the following :
 *  - change the current wrapper name 'wcode' to any name you chooze in the #define WRAPPERNAME macro.
 *  - adapt the signatures of the calls. You have to write the function in another file and link
 *        the wrapper with the corresponding object file. But, due to some technical
 *        aspect of C/FORTRAN linking, you have to declare your FORTRAN function to C in
 *        a special manner and use the F77_FUNC macro below. Don't worry, it's easy !
 *        First, change the name 'wcode' everywhere in the macro to the name of your FORTRAN
 *        subroutine. Second, declare the arguments passed to the subroutine in a prototype
 *        declaration. Remember that all FORTRAN arguments are passed as reference (aka pointers)
 *        conversely to C. Long and double in C match INTEGER*4 and REAL*8 in FORTRAN
 *        respectively. Avoid using strings.
 *  - call your C function in the execute function of your wrapper.
