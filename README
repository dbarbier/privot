** Welcome to Open TURNS ! **

Before trying to compile and install the software, be sure to get access to some
mandatory tools Open TURNS relies upon. These are (at least):
* R (available at http://r-project.org)
* BOOST (available at http://www.boost.org)
* Xerces library (available at http://www.apache.org)
* Qt (available at http://www.trolltech.com)
* etc.

You may check the full list with the corresponding version at our website:
http://www.openturns.org
in the "Downloading and installing" section.

When you are done with those dependencies, you can process with the compilation and installation.
See the INSTALL file for instructions.

For the quick readers:
./configure --prefix=<your_local_path>
make
make check
make install
make installcheck

Don't skip the check stages. They assure you the software you've just compiled behaves correctly.

Enjoy !
The OpenTURNS' development TEAM.
