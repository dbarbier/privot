rev. 410:
src/Uncertainty/Distribution/TruncatedNormal: better algorithm for getRealization() based on mixed rejection algorithms
src/Uncertainty/Distribution/TruncatedNormalFactory: Better algorithm based on the resolution of the implicit relations between the moments and the parameters
rev. 418:
Promote all the structs Pair to classes with save/load mechanisms
Add a NumericalFunction constructor based on a Distribution, with a selector between CDF, PDF and DDF for the wrapped method. It will allow to:
+ use all the solvers in the Solver hierarchy;
+ compose specific parts of the IsoProbabilistic transformation
+ build methods to find modes of a distribution.
